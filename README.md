## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use flexbox to centralize html block elements.

```css
main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I will be looking up more 'semantic' ways of structuring and styling web pages and also learning the CSS Grid styling.
JavaScript is tough!

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for the Flexbox method of styling.
